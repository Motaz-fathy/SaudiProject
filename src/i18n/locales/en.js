        Containers have revolutionized the world of shipping goods and changed
        global shipping systems. Today, ninety percent of goods are
        transported in containers that are stacked on the decks of giant sea
        tankers, and the number of shipments shipped worldwide currently
        amounts to two hundred million containers annually. Standardizing the
        size of containers worldwide has contributed to changing the
        measurements of ships, cars, and train cars to suit the sizes and
        capacities of twenty-foot and forty-foot containers.
